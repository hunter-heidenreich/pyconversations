    "Interfacing with 4chan data _does not_ require any secret keys or tokens or anyting of that nature. Instead, we'll directly use a package called `BASC-py4chan` which provides [an object-oriented interface](https://basc-py4chan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for interacting with the 4chan API. \n",
